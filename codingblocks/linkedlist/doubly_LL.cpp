//advantage: can go in both dirn
//usage: when target t given to add at this place new element; dLL can go to prev and add new element
//while in single LL need to traverse from start till target then insert
//In STL: forwardlist is sinlgly LL and list is doublyLL

//circularLL, tail points to head
//can use to implement circular queue
//other algo use as well in comp prog
