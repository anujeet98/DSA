Arrays
Vector (Dynamic Array)

More DS
---------
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Trees (Binary Tree & BST)
- Heaps (Priority Queue)
- Graphs
- Hashtables
- Tries


Advance DS:
- Segment Trees
- Fenwick Tree
- AVL Tree


Why do we need so many DS?
- 	each dc has own speciality
-	depending upon problem
-	insertion,deletion, 	searching, ordering
-	space and time complexity
