// You and your friend are playing a game with hoops. There are N hoops (where N is odd) in a row. You jump into hoop 1, and your friend jumps into hoop N. Then you jump into hoop 2, and after that, your friend jumps into hoop Nâˆ’1, and so on.

// The process ends when someone cannot make the next jump because the hoop is occupied by the other person. Find the last hoop that will be jumped into.

// Input
// The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
// Each test case contains a single line of input, a single integer N.
// Output
// For each testcase, output in a single line the answer to the problem
